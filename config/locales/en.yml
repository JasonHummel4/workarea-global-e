          Fixed prices allow you to specify country or currency for that price.  A fixed price that doesn't
          specify a currency will be the default price for any country that uses that currency.  If a fixed
          price is present, users browsing or shipping to that country or using the specified currency will
          see the fixed price.  If no fixed price is present, the default price will display using global
          normal price conversion.
